### Description:
The goal of our group is to design and develop an e-commerce website that will have 
a number of functionalities based on the customers expectations. The website will provide 
the ability for a user to create a listing of an item they would like to sell, and provide a way
for buyers to search through items with categories tagged to each listing. Listings will be 
monitored by admin accounts to ensure no illegal items are being sold.

### Features:
The platform will be able to perform the following functionalities.
- Users with different roles (Buyer, Seller, Admin) should be able to login into their
accounts to be able to perform different actions and logout.
- A buyer should be able to search, compare, buy and return different types of products
from different sellers, each item will have category tags that the buyer will be able to search
through, and compare items based on price of the listing.
- A seller should be able to add, sell and receive payments for their available products.
- An admin should be able to approve/block new user accounts and products, and
oversee different user actions.

### Tools and frameworks:
- html
- css
- django
